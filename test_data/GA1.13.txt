Let's make sure you know how to use GitHub. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one. Create a new public repository. Commit a single JSON file called email.json with the value {"email": "23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in"} and push it.

Enter the raw Github URL of email.json so we can verify it. (It might look like https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[GITHUB ID]/[REPO NAME]/main/email.json.)
