SecurePay, a leading fintech startup, has implemented an innovative feature to detect and prevent fraudulent activities in real time. As part of its security suite, the system analyzes personalized transaction messages by converting them into embeddings. These embeddings are compared against known patterns of legitimate and fraudulent messages to flag unusual activity.

Imagine you are working on the SecurePay team as a junior developer tasked with integrating the text embeddings feature into the fraud detection module. When a user initiates a transaction, the system sends a personalized verification message to the user's registered email address. This message includes the user's email address and a unique transaction code (a randomly generated number). Here are 2 verification messages:

Dear user, please verify your transaction code 9881 sent to 23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
Dear user, please verify your transaction code 4645 sent to 23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
The goal is to capture this message, convert it into a meaningful embedding using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model, and subsequently use the embedding in a machine learning model to detect anomalies.

Your task is to write the JSON body for a POST request that will be sent to the OpenAI API endpoint to obtain the text embedding for the 2 given personalized transaction verification messages above. This will be sent to the endpoint https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings.
