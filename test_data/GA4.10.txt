EduDocs Inc. is a leading provider of educational resources and documentation management solutions for academic institutions. With a growing client base comprising universities, colleges, and online learning platforms, EduDocs emphasizes the importance of accessible, well-formatted digital documentation. To maintain high standards and streamline their content delivery, EduDocs continually seeks to enhance its documentation workflows and ensure consistency across all materials.

EduDocs manages a vast repository of educational materials, including course syllabi, lecture notes, research papers, and administrative documents. These materials are often provided by clients in various formats, predominantly PDF, which poses challenges for content reuse, editing, and integration into digital platforms.

Manually converting PDF documents to Markdown is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when dealing with large volumes of documents. Additionally, ensuring that the converted Markdown adheres to consistent formatting standards is crucial for maintaining the professional quality of EduDocs' deliverables.

To address these challenges, EduDocs aims to automate and standardize the conversion of PDF documents to Markdown format, ensuring that all Markdown files are consistently formatted using Prettier 3.4.2. This initiative will improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and enhance the overall quality of the documentation provided to clients.
