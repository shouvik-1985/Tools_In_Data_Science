AgroTech Insights is a leading agricultural technology company that provides data-driven solutions to farmers and agribusinesses. By leveraging advanced analytics and real-time data, AgroTech helps optimize crop yields, manage resources efficiently, and mitigate risks associated with adverse weather conditions. Accurate and timely weather forecasts are crucial for making informed decisions in agricultural planning and management.

Farmers and agribusinesses rely heavily on precise weather information to plan planting schedules, irrigation, harvesting, and protect crops from extreme weather events. However, accessing and processing weather data from multiple sources can be time-consuming and technically challenging. AgroTech Insights seeks to automate the extraction and transformation of weather data to provide seamless, actionable insights to its clients.

AgroTech Insights has partnered with various stakeholders to enhance its weather forecasting capabilities. One of the key requirements is to integrate weather forecast data for specific regions to support crop management strategies. For this purpose, AgroTech utilizes the BBC Weather API, a reliable source of detailed weather information.

Your Task
As part of this initiative, you are tasked with developing a system that automates the following:

API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather forecast for Prague. Send a GET request to the locator service to obtain the city's locationId. Include necessary query parameters such as API key, locale, filters, and search term (city).
Weather Data Extraction: Retrieve the weather forecast data using the obtained locationId. Send a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint with the locationId.
Data Transformation: Extract the localDate and enhancedWeatherDescription from each day's forecast. Iterate through the forecasts array in the API response and map each localDate to its corresponding enhancedWeatherDescription. Create a JSON object where each key is the localDate and the value is the enhancedWeatherDescription.
The output would look like this:

{
  "2025-01-01": "Sunny with scattered clouds",
  "2025-01-02": "Partly cloudy with a chance of rain",
  "2025-01-03": "Overcast skies",
  // ... additional days
}
