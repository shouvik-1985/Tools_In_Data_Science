DevSync Solutions is a mid-sized software development company specializing in collaborative tools for remote teams. With a growing client base and an expanding portfolio of projects, DevSync emphasizes efficient workflow management and robust version control practices to maintain high-quality software delivery.

As part of their commitment to maintaining seamless and transparent development processes, DevSync has identified the need to implement automated daily updates to their GitHub repositories. These updates serve multiple purposes:

Activity Tracking: Ensuring that each repository reflects daily activity helps in monitoring project progress and team engagement.
Automated Documentation: Regular commits can be used to update status files, logs, or documentation without manual intervention.
Backup and Recovery: Automated commits provide an additional layer of backup, ensuring that changes are consistently recorded.
Compliance and Auditing: Maintaining a clear commit history aids in compliance with industry standards and facilitates auditing processes.
Manually managing these daily commits is inefficient and prone to human error, especially as the number of repositories grows. To address this, DevSync seeks to automate the process using GitHub Actions, ensuring consistency, reliability, and scalability across all projects.

DevSync's DevOps team has decided to standardize the implementation of GitHub Actions across all company repositories. The objective is to create a scheduled workflow that runs once daily, adds a commit to the repository, and ensures that these actions are consistently tracked and verifiable.

As a junior developer or DevOps engineer at DevSync, you are tasked with setting up this automation for a specific repository. This exercise will not only enhance your understanding of GitHub Actions but also contribute to the company's streamlined workflow management.

Your Task
Create a scheduled GitHub action that runs daily and adds a commit to your repository. The workflow should:

Use schedule with cron syntax to run once per day (must use specific hours/minutes, not wildcards)
Include a step with your email 23f2004837@ds.study.iitm.ac.in in its name
Create a commit in each run
Be located in .github/workflows/ directory
After creating the workflow:

Trigger the workflow and wait for it to complete
Ensure it appears as the most recent action in your repository
Verify that it creates a commit during or within 5 minutes of the workflow run
Enter your repository URL (format: https://github.com/USER/REPO):
