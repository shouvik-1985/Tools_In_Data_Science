EduTrack Systems is a leading provider of educational management software that helps schools and universities maintain accurate and up-to-date student records. EduTrack's platform is used by administrators to monitor academic performance, manage enrollment, and generate reports for compliance and strategic planning.

In many educational institutions, student data is collected from multiple sources—such as handwritten forms, scanned documents, and digital submissions—which can lead to duplicate records. These duplicates cause inefficiencies in reporting and can lead to incorrect decision-making when it comes to resource allocation, student support, and performance analysis.

Recently, EduTrack received a text file containing student exam results that were processed through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) from legacy documents. The file is formatted with lines structured as follows:

NAME STUDENT ID Marks MARKS

 Alice  - A293:Marks 32

Bob - BD29DMarks 53

Charlie - XF28:Marks40
The data spans multiple subjects and time periods. The file will contain duplicate entries for the same student (identified by the second field), and it is crucial to count only unique students for accurate reporting.

Your Task
As a data analyst at EduTrack Systems, your task is to process this text file and determine the number of unique students based on their student IDs. This deduplication is essential to:

Ensure Accurate Reporting: Avoid inflated counts in enrollment and performance reports.
Improve Data Quality: Clean the dataset for further analytics, such as tracking academic progress or resource allocation.
Optimize Administrative Processes: Provide administrators with reliable data to support decision-making.
You need to do the following:

Data Extraction: Read the text file line by line. Parse each line to extract the student ID.
Deduplication: Remove duplicates from the student ID list.
Reporting: Count the number of unique student IDs present in the file.
By accurately identifying the number of unique students, EduTrack Systems will:

Enhance Data Integrity: Ensure that subsequent analyses and reports reflect the true number of individual students.
Reduce Administrative Errors: Minimize the risk of misinformed decisions that can arise from duplicate entries.
Streamline Resource Allocation: Provide accurate student counts for budgeting, staffing, and planning academic programs.
Improve Compliance Reporting: Ensure adherence to regulatory requirements by maintaining precise student records.
