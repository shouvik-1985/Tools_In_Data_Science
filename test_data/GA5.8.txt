EngageMetrics is a digital marketing analytics firm that specializes in tracking and analyzing social media engagement. Their clients, ranging from major brands to local businesses, rely on data-driven insights to optimize content strategy, measure campaign performance, and identify posts that drive significant user interaction.

Social media platforms generate vast amounts of user-generated content, including posts, comments, likes, and ratings. One key metric that EngageMetrics uses is the “usefulness” of comments on posts. A comment rated highly on usefulness is a strong indicator that a post is engaging and valuable to its audience.

However, the raw data is complex and stored in a DuckDB table called social_media, which is generated by a simulated dataset. Each row in the table represents a post with the following fields:

post_id: A unique identifier for the post.
username: The user who created the post.
timestamp: The time when the post was made.
comments: A JSON array containing comments. Each comment includes:
commenter: The user who commented.
text: The comment text.
stars: An object with two properties, funny and useful, representing the rating stars for that comment.
Due to the dynamic nature of social media, EngageMetrics wants to focus on the most recent posts and, within those, identify posts where at least one comment has received a high number of useful stars. This allows the firm to spotlight content that is not only fresh but also resonating well with the audience.

Your Task
Your task as a data analyst at EngageMetrics is to write a query that performs the following:

Filter Posts by Date: Consider only posts with a timestamp greater than or equal to a specified minimum time (2024-12-23T08:13:36.512Z), ensuring that the analysis focuses on recent posts.
Evaluate Comment Quality: From these recent posts, identify posts where at least one comment has received more than a given number of useful stars (2). This criterion filters out posts with low or mediocre engagement.
Extract and Sort Post IDs: Finally, extract all the post_id values of the posts that meet these criteria and sort them in ascending order.
By accurately extracting these high-impact post IDs, EngageMetrics can:

Enhance Reporting: Provide clients with focused insights on posts that are currently engaging audiences effectively.
Target Content Strategy: Help marketing teams identify trending content themes that generate high-quality user engagement.
Optimize Resource Allocation: Enable better prioritization for content promotion and further in-depth analysis of high-performing posts.
Write a DuckDB SQL query to find all posts IDs after 2024-12-23T08:13:36.512Z with at least 1 comment with 2 useful stars, sorted. The result should be a table with a single column called post_id, and the relevant post IDs should be sorted in ascending order.
