Mystery Tales Publishing is an independent publisher specializing in mystery and suspense audiobooks. To broaden their audience and improve accessibility, they have been uploading narrated versions of their stories to YouTube. In addition to reaching visually impaired users, they want to leverage transcripts for content summarization, search indexing, and social media promotion.
